### Example

```
 <article>
                <div id="online-reputation-management" class="online-reputation-management">
                    <img src="./assets/images/online-reputation-management.jpg" 
                    alt="Laptop displaying graphs and the word 'reputation'"
                    class="float-right" />

                    <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>

                    <p>
                        The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. 
                        Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever 
                        they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you 
                        the control over what potential customers see when they search for your 
                        business.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </article> 
```
